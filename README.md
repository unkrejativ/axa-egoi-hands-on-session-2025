# 🚀 Hands-On Session: Train Your Model & Optimize Your Gini Score! 

Welcome to the Hands on Session of AXA Insurance Group at EGOI. Here, you’ll dive into the world of machine learning by training your very own model and optimizing its Gini score.💪

## 📖 Our Storyline
Picture this: You and your team at AXA are on a mission to support our data scientists and actuaries in the field of car insurance! 🚗

Your goal is to help predict whether a claim at a car will occur or not. 
By doing this, you and your Co-data scientists will empower our experts to make more informed decisions about our risks and pricing strategies.

This is not just any training session—it's a **Challenge**!✨ 
You will be competing against other teams to see who can develop the best model.


## 🛠️ First things first: Setting Up the Environment
Let’s get your environment ready to rock! Follow these steps:



## 🏆 Training the Model and try to optimize the Gini Score
Now the fun begins! After understanding the data bases try to find the best model by asking yourself which information will have the biggest impact on a car claim. 

Discuss with your team which predictors you would like to use and change or add them to the code. 

Hint: A model with all possible predictors will not lead to the best Gini 😉

Which team will have the model with the best Gini-Score?
